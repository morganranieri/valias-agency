short stories(
  about an emo programmer
  with a system that didn't work as he expected
  behind the scenes was a lot of prople doing a lot of things 
  the system theory was that people will do better work if they don't know about the harsh realities 
  who unintentially fed a machine with names of kids who the system flagged for termination

  editor: ffs can you lighten up 

  the story is set in a different world - don't stress 

  editor: any positivity? 

  there was a great music scene
